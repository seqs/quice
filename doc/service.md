Quice Service
=============

A Service is a generic term for any PHP object that performs a specific task. A service is usually used "globally", such as a database access object or an object that delivers email messages. In Quice, services are often configured and retrieved from the module. An application that has many decoupled services is said to follow a service-oriented architecture.
