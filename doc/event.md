Quice Event
===========

Event is a PHP library that provides a lightweight implementation of the Observer design pattern. It's a good way to make your code more flexible. It's also a great way to make your code easily extensible by others. Third-party code listens to specific events by registering PHP callbacks and the dispatcher called them whenever your code notifies these events.
